F100 Values
===========

All floating point values are encoded with a precision
of to digits as int32 values. What exactly does this mean?

Let's start with an example:
----------------------------

The current measured weight is ``22.7576``. The
transmitted value is calculated like this:
``int(22.7576 * 100.0 + 0.5)`` which gives us
a value of ``2276``. The value is then packet
in four bytes. The first two bytes represent then
*HighWord* of the value and the next two bytes
represent the *LowWord* of the value. Both *words*
are packed in *HighByte* / *LowByte*.

So the value ``22.7576`` would be converted
to ``2276`` and then packed as: **TODO**


=================== =========================
``HighWord(val)``   ``(val >> 16) & 0xFFFF``
``LowWord(val)``    ``val & 0xFFFF``
``HighByte(val)``   ``(val >> 8) & 0xFF``
``LowByte(val)``    ``val & 0xFF``
=================== =========================
