Entering the Command Mode
=========================

1. Connect the board via USB to your computer.
2. Press and hold the ``CMB`` Button
3. Push the ``RESET`` Button. After a couple
   of seconds, the status led should be constantly
   on, telling us, we are in ``command mode``.

Time for a *Wohoo*.
