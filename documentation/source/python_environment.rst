Setting up the NeoBee Python Library
====================================

If you start with a fresh installalation of the firmware, the controller is not configured.
For example the controller does not know which wifi networt to connect to.

Therefore the controller automacitally boots into AP (Access Point) mode. You should find a new 
WiFi network called "NeoBee" you can connect to without the need of any credentials.

.. note::
    Of course the controller does not act as a router or dns server. So beware of the fact that
    as long as you are connected to the controller you cannot access the internet or other lokal
    ressources.

At least for the configuration of the wifi network, the computer needs to be connected to this
neobee hotspot.
